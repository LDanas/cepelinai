            <h1>Lithuanian Dish - Cepelinai</h1>
            <p>So, from all the foods you've decided to choose, you chose ,,Cepelinai". Good choice! Wouldn't have chosen otherwise myself, as cepelinai truly represents the heart of Lithuanian cuisine. Originating in Lithuania, cepelinai have been enjoyed for generations, tracing back to the early 19th century when potato cultivation became widespread. These dumplings, named after the zeppelin airships due to their shape, combine grated potatoes and savory fillings, showcasing the hearty and comforting nature of traditional Lithuanian food. They embody a rich culinary tradition that continues to delight locals and visitors alike.</p>
